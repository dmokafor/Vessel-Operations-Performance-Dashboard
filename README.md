# Vessel Operations Performance Dashboard
## Project Overview
This dashboard provides real-time updates on on-going vessel operations and crane activities at the port providing a comprehensive view of key performance indicators related to vessel activity, crane usage, and cargo handling. The primary objective of the dashboard is to enable users to monitor and track the efficiency of ongoing operations, promptly identify bottlenecks or issues, and take immediate remedial actions to optimize vessel port stay and overall port performance.
This dashboard is designed for display on a TV wall in the control room.
