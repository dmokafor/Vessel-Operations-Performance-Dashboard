# Vessel Operations Performance Dashboard
## Project Overview
This dashboard provides real-time updates on on-going vessel operations and crane activities at the port providing a comprehensive view of key performance indicators related to vessel activity, crane usage, and cargo handling. The primary objective of the dashboard is to enable users to monitor and track the efficiency of ongoing operations, promptly identify bottlenecks or issues, and take immediate remedial actions to optimize vessel port stay and overall port performance.

This dashboard is designed for display on a TV wall in the control room.

## Dashboard Features

- The card visuals represent the three (3) berths of the Terminal. Each berth can be identified by the accent color of each card which is consistently applied throughout the dashboard.
- Each card also serves as navigation buttons to see more details about the vessel working.

- A major KPI for the Terminal is the Port Hours Saved (PHS).
- Other KPIs include: Estimated Time of Completion (ETC), Estimated Rime of Departure (ETD), Required Time of Departure (RTD) to meet PHS target.
