# Vessel Operations Performance Dashboard
## Project Overview
This dashboard provides real-time updates on on-going vessel operations and crane activities at the port providing a comprehensive view of key performance indicators related to vessel activity, crane usage, and cargo handling. The primary objective of the dashboard is to enable users to monitor and track the efficiency of ongoing operations, promptly identify bottlenecks or issues, and take immediate remedial actions to optimize vessel port stay and overall port performance.

This dashboard is designed for display on a TV wall in the control room.

## Dashboard Walkthrough
Below is the overview page of the Power BI dashboard which shows the performance of vessels currently working at berth. 
The interactive dashboard can be found here.

### The Card Visual
The card visual shows the vessels actively working at the quay, with each card representing a berth, distinguished by a consistent accent color applied consistently throughout the dashboard.

Each card displays:
- Vessel information: berth, name of the vessel, service, and shipping line.
- Critical KPIs: Port Hours Saved (PHS), Required Time of Departure (RTD) to meet PHS target.
- Other KPIs: Crane Moves Per Hour (CMPH) and Total Moves (Sum of executed and balance), Crane Intensity (CI), and Percent of Completion
Additionally, each card functions as a navigation button, allowing users to access more detailed vessel information.
